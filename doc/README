$ make

If compilation fails, go to "Compilation Errors" section to look for possible
reasons and solutions. If everything went fine, install QNapi:

Bugs Reporting
===============
Any bugs found may be reported using github bugtracker:
https://github.com/konserw/Qnapi/issues

From original QNapi by Krzemin (may not match curnent version)
==============================================================

Compilation Errors
==================

If make command throws an error similar to the following:

"make: *** No rules to make object"

It means that Makefile has to be regenerated. To do so run qmake/qmake-qt4
again. Afterwards, if qmake did not throw any error, try to build the program
one more time (see 'Installation' section above).

For other compilation errors please report a bug. (see 'Bug Reporting' section
below).


Integration with file managers
==============================

If you want to integrate QNapi with your window manager, follow instruction
presented below for your WM.

KDE (Dolphin/Konqueror)
-----------------------
WARNING: Since version 0.1.4 QNapi should automatically integrate with Dolphin
and Konqueror. However it does not integrate, do the following:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You'll need qnapi-download.dekstop, which you can get from doc/ subdirectory
in source archive, from /usr/share/doc/qnapi after installing QNapi or from
website http://krzemin.iglu.cz/qnapi

Copy it to the following directories:
 * ~/.kde/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus/
 * ~/.kde/share/apps/d3lphin/servicemenus/
 * ~/.kde/share/apps/dolphin/servicemenus/

Or globally (needs superuser priviledges):
 * /usr/share/apps/konqueror/servicemenus/
 * /usr/share/apps/d3lphin/servicemenus/
 * /usr/share/apps/dolphin/servicemenus/

For KDE4:

* ~/.kde4/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/

Globally for KDE4:
 * /usr/lib/kde4/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/

Above-mentioned directories may differ in your distribution, depends on where
KDE is installed.

Nautilus (GNOME)
----------------
WARNING: Since 0.1.5 version QNapi should automatically integrate with Nautilus
after you had installed qnapi-gnome package, proper for your distribution.
Restart of the system (or reload gconfd daemon) is required.

If automatic integration doesn't work or you don't want (can't) install
additional package, you can use alternative way to integrate QNapi with
Nautilus:

You need to install nautilus-actions package and qnapi-download.schemas file,
which you can get from doc/ subdirectory in source archive, from
/usr/share/doc/qnapi after installing QNapi or from website
http://krzemin.iglu.cz/qnapi. You only need to copy it to
/usr/share/gconf/schemas/ and execute following command:

$ sudo gconf-schemas --register /usr/share/gconf/schemas/qnapi-download.schemas

If this does not help, you can also try to import qnapi-download.schemas file
using nautilus-actions-config tool.

Thunar (XFCE)
-------------

Integration with Tunar requires to run the program choose
"Edit" -> "Configure custom actions". In the dialog box press a "plus"
button. New "Create Action" dialog will appear. In this dialog on "Basic"
tab set:
Name: "Fetch subtitles with QNapi"
Description: (whatever)
Command: qnapi %F

You can choose icon from a file (e. g. /usr/share/icons/qnapi-48.png).
On the "Appearance Conditions" tab you only have to check "Video Files".
Then clink OK and it's done.
